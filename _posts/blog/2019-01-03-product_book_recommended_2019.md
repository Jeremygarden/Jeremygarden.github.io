As admitting one viewpoint that there might be some gaps between engineers' mindset and product manager's one, I think the best way is to share the great resources and let ourselves go across domain knowledge so that we can get deeper comprehensions on how PMs approach the business ideas and solve user's problems which two things most engineers always think are easy and cheesy. But I think we all would have been doing better and now I want to call out some really awesome books down here.

Update: (Mar 15, 2019)

Completed Inspired and Decisive and I really like it.

Especially Decisive would become my handbook when making a choice. We actually don't even meet the best choice ever but need to balance and weigh out the better one. Also never narrow your range and go wider, test your hypothesis in the real-life by not just finding info to only support what we assumed. More importantly we need and we have to do a well prep for wrong track and accept failure.

Try to avoid read fragmented info but go back to books, I can feel my mind is literally flowing and thinking.

Keep Going!
