Recently I heard of the Google Material Design, the most hot and famous design Bible. So I went through the most part of it on my iPad at some toilet time...


At the first glance, I didn't pay much attention to what it defines about itself and how to demostrate the essentials of it. Honestly, I don't even feel like how superior the Google designers represent their thought on the web pages, Instead I like the way less bolder about color sets, richer but no-obvious interactions on user end. I think that is funnier because at one time I am freaking into Online RPG games. So I wouldn't give a shit if I will be a Head of design team, seriously. Sorry for any fans of Material Design if you check out this post.

But seems like storys doesn't end and I was stupid...
Something only when you think of it peace and quiet, of course will changes you mind.

The 3 golden principles that I will add up my explanations:

1. Material is metaphor
In my opinion, a good designer is supposed to be a good lifer. Not just simply like a skilled fashionist who owns first-class taste of style's trends, but own some built-in function that called aesthetic taste in your blood. A simple pump gear, a tiny terrance, a not-that-mess street. All matters contains your understanding of better designs, carefully and sincerely treats our surroundings will inspire ourselfs inside.

2. Bold, Graphic, Intentional
New era is coming for younger ages and radical ideas. Well-designed products should not to yield the most thoughts, but cater to the nicest users. The boldness, graphics and lots of intentions means the way of pureness of designer's heart. It's difficult to cater for all tastes, always happen. So be yourself, do your beautiful thing you think. I bet that is the best move. That is "A-R-T" all about.

3. Motions provides meaning.
I think the most modern elegant web pages means more than rich motions.
Avoiding the overdrawing your "animation credit account", we better clearify what the product would be on earth or what the final issues need to be solved instead of putting seemingly awesome effects to attract more potentials users. You at least have to care about your original intentions and your current users. Only emphasize on core functionality makes the simpler, neater interface for users. 


The reason why I look into the Material Design is not only I guess I have something on design maybe, possible, sort of...(that's why I also touch wireframing, sketching, A/B testing, etc.), but currently as a developer or engineer(whatever you name it), it really helps me to better understand how the design process goes behind the scenes and I think this might be the more effective way to communicate and collaborate with designers in dev environment. To make good product together, put myself in other's shoes, it's always no bad.
