Takeaways from TripAdvisor Data Science PM @Product School Boston


![@PS Boston](https://assets.productschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/05160936/productschool_logo-productcon.png)
I went to the well-known meetup called Product School last week. I believe I first got hooked with it via my podcast app, where A lot of PMs share a handful great experiences and how they build/ship products. Also checked out a bunch on Youtube as they did kind of streaming or recording some times. Then I found out they host a event with Tripadvisor in Boston this time, Always want to hear some more mixed voice from Tripadvisor product side on what they are doing and how they catch up with in the market, so just can't miss and need to be around there.

It started off diving into DS to some extent which is great. Engineer-oriented always get a solid foundation :) , what's more is helping me to brush up a bit of DS I did before in the past, like outliers, overfitting, ML algorithms, cross validation all kind of fun stuffs. But after knowing their users and personas, I got a BIG question, 

How do they define success metrics as if DS could achieve self-justified result to get optimal results, how does DS get PM work with together? 

1. Data Science Model 
   * Reserved price in B2C and C2C marketplace
2. How product and DS work together?
   * Enhanced experience and functionality
   * Internal functions and business logic
   * expansion to new verticals and products
3. Improving testing framework
   * Traffic split Testing: User Behavior
   * Market Testing: Anticipated feedback loop
   * Production Testing: Small group testing

Some notes from slides summary as above. I was glad to get a rational response from them, but not detailed though. What I was thinking at that point is, 



I can't agree more with words, which I quoted from [Evans's blog](https://www.ben-evans.com/):

> Part of the challenge of machine learning is not just working out what problems to solve but working out how to surface that to the user. Some of this may just be branding - we may need to say “this is ‘AI’” to set expectations 

and I believe THIS is the issue or I would say it as bottleneck from product manager align with DS or ML division, who need to seriously cool down the mind and consider it, beside defining WHAT they will go down the road, or satisfying stakeholders and more importantly, users in the real market. That seemingly not adequate or even not touch the bar yet. 

But Tripadvior has been doing great in the past and I heard a lot of good things about them, especially their product & engineering division. They are boosting non-hotel business segment incrediblly by focusing more on experiences and restaurants, It's smart to avoid fighting in the red sea market targeting to non-hotel accommodations and disrupt the new fields in future. Hope TripAdvisor will keep up and doing great!

After this post, I think I will share my thought (well a chill and talky, but more constructive and informative way) when I attend some fun meetup.



I want to jot down a word for myself:
