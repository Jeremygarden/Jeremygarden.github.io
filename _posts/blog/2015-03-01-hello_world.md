Hi. How are you? I don't really know how to start these things. 

While fiddling around with building my website, the thought of starting a real niche for recording my ideas and works came to my mind.

I’ll even make this blog into some sort of note; jotting down my experiences as I journey through this thing called life. Sounds like a plan. 

Well, I better introduce myself. My name is Jeremy (Mingxuan) Li. 

A well-made product with hybrid background and attributes from the Northwest highland of China. I am afraid of stuffy weather and enjoy chasing my puppy in the rain/snow.

But I am not that glommy,though. I just love the moments that I am able to quiet down and chill with myself by classic music.

Except achohol, there must be something else drive guys crazy. For me, I would say ball games and driving. A true sport fanatic. I was a SG(Shooting Guard) till I graduated from high school. After that, I play badminton, tennis and 8-balls pool. You say Ping-pong? Damn, you know where I come from. 

Enough to digress from my serious intro...

I pursued my Master Degree in Northeastern Univesity, Boston. My major is Information Systems(formerly Computer Engineering). My technical interests and focus are mainly about front-end development including up-to-date modern frameworks, UI/UX design, plus a bit amateur skill of mechine learning and data mining. But I'm also comfortable with Java and Spring MVC, SQL and etc. 

I like the feelings pretty much when I fixs some problems, get something "Unchecked" done and keep learning something new. The curiousity makes me alive in a long run. I probably stop coding if a perfectly prime rib is just placed in front of my face. However, I try my best to not be a code monkey, but the one who really understands about critical thinking, collaboration with teams, full empathy for users and embracing unpredictable changes. 


I hope I will be able to design and develop a nice online product with my friends some day. 


Let’s make this blog about the evolving perceptions of my life and mentality.

Thanks for reading. 

Jeremy
